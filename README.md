Phase 1.1: L-exp Scanner
This program will:
* Take 2 inputs from the command line (described in ** Use **)
* Open the input file and pass each line to the scanner
* The scanner will return a container of token objects (each object has a value and type)
* This program will print identified tokens to the output file (with type and value info)


## Use:
``` python scanner.py test_input.txt test_output.txt```
* test_input.txt is the text file with the test input
* test_output.txt is the text file with this program's output
